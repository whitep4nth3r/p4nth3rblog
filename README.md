Day 1:

Learnings:

## getStaticProps

data fetched and pages generated at build time

Good for data that doesn't change often - i.e. with social links, blog posts, nav links

Limitations - can only getStaticProps on 'pages' (i.e. js files in the /pages directory)

## getServerSideProps

data fetched at run time (good for data that changes often)
