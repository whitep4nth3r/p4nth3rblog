    <p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">I discovered live coding serendipitously on Twitch for the first time in mid June 2020. I was instantly hooked on the huge sense of community, the opportunities to learn, and the way in which the platform increases access to and engagement in science and technology content across the world.</p><blockquote class="Typography_blockquote__12baU"><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">I hesitantly pressed the go-live button for the very first time around a week and a half later on Thursday 25th June. Within seven days I had reached Affiliate status on Twitch, and had amassed a core group of regular viewers who continued to join me on my streams.</p></blockquote><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">I&#x27;m still not entirely sure why people choose to watch my content, but what I am sure of, is that the more we can grow and engage with the science and technology community through streaming a variety of content, the more people we can empower through tech to grow their own futures in this ever-evolving world.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">For anyone who&#x27;s thinking about getting started with streaming live coding, I&#x27;ve put together six valuable lessons I learned in my first six weeks on Twitch to hopefully make you a little bit less hesitant about pressing that go-live button.</p><h2 class="Typography_heading__h2__3F_Oq">1. You don&#x27;t need a pro set up to get started</h2><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">There&#x27;s no need to invest in expensive kit when you&#x27;re just starting out. In fact, I would highly recommend that you buy absolutely nothing in preparation for your first few streams - because you don&#x27;t really know what you&#x27;re going to need until your content starts evolving.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">All you really need to get started is a laptop with an in-built microphone and webcam (if you want to show your face), some streaming software such as OBS (available for free), and something to do on your stream.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK"><b class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK Typography_bodyCopy__bold__1jGZn">That&#x27;s it!</b></p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Anything else is overkill and will certainly give you a lot more to worry about as you go live for the first time.</p><blockquote class="Typography_blockquote__12baU"><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">More kit definitely means more problems, so start slow, and adapt as you go.</p></blockquote><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Once you&#x27;ve found your rhythm and developed your style, and your community is starting to grow, then is the time to figure out how to increase the production value of your stream - <i>whatever that may mean for you.</i></p><div class="RichTextPageContent_page__imgContainer__3my1e"><div style="display:block;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="display:block;box-sizing:border-box;padding-top:56.10000000000001%"></div><img alt="A screenshot of whitep4nth3r&#x27;s simple stream overlays from the early days of streaming in 2020." src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" style="visibility:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/></div></div><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">I started out with a laptop with an inbuilt webcam and microphone, and truthfully, that was all I needed.</p><h2 class="Typography_heading__h2__3F_Oq">2. You will have tech issues!</h2><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">When the time comes for you to work on the production quality of your stream - you will, no doubt, have technical issues. <b class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK Typography_bodyCopy__bold__1jGZn">Dropped frames, audio out of sync with the webcam image, &#x27;Minecraft style resolution&#x27; (yes, that was an exact quote from a viewer), white balance issues, flickering webcam image and lack of processing power</b> - these are just <i>some</i> of the issues I&#x27;ve faced as I started to evolve my setup.</p><blockquote class="Typography_blockquote__12baU"><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Viewers will point out your technical issues - and this feedback is a gift.</p></blockquote><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Viewers <b class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK Typography_bodyCopy__bold__1jGZn">will</b> point out your technical issues - and whilst this can seem stressful whilst you&#x27;re trying to stay on top of your content and engage with the chat - this feedback is a gift - and it shows that your viewers are engaged and want to see you succeed.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">If it&#x27;s not possible to tweak those issues as they happen, experiment with different settings and approaches to solving your problems off-stream, and <i>always crowdsource advice.</i></p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK"><i>Here are some of the key things I&#x27;ve learned about the optimum technical setup:</i></p><h3 class="Typography_heading__h3__2AeD6">1. To minimise your chance of dropped frames, do not stream using WiFi</h3><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">If you can&#x27;t deal with a 50m long ethernet cable trailing up/down your stairs, try a powerline adaptor.</p><h3 class="Typography_heading__h3__2AeD6">2. If your programming is CPU-intensive, try a dual machine setup</h3><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">I know this isn&#x27;t the most cost-effective solution, but I was lucky to have a PC sitting idly below my desk (thanks, husband for your PC-building hobby!). I now use a PC to run OBS and stream via powerline, whilst I code on my Macbook that is connected to the PC via a capture card.</p><h3 class="Typography_heading__h3__2AeD6">3. If your shiny new camera flickers randomly, use default Windows drivers and USB 2.0</h3><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">I recently switched to using a Logitech Streamcam for the 60FPS and 1080p resolution, but I had nightmare after nightmare trying to work out why the camera was flickering every now and then. After focussing on the camera settings, trying <i>everything</i> and almost rage quitting streaming, I found the solution was software-based. I switched to using Windows default drivers rather than the Logitech drivers, and purchased an adaptor to plug the proprietry USB C connector into USB 2.0. <b class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK Typography_bodyCopy__bold__1jGZn">And my problem was solved!</b></p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">(This might have been a unique problem to me due to the first generation USB C hardware on the motherboard in the PC, but if I can help at least one other person with this advice, then it&#x27;s definitely worth mentioning!)</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK"><i>Stay tuned for a blog post that talks about my streaming setup in detail!</i></p><h2 class="Typography_heading__h2__3F_Oq">3. Engage with your community</h2><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">I&#x27;ve dropped in on a few streams where the streamer doesn&#x27;t engage with the chat so actively. In streams with hundreds and thousands of viewers, this isn&#x27;t expected to happen, but I think you can definitely comfortably engage with most of what&#x27;s going on in the chat if you have under 200 viewers. When a streamer doesn&#x27;t engage with the chat and is able to, I usually tend to bounce right out.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">I love hanging out on streams where the streamer is engaged with the chat; it feels really sociable, like you&#x27;re hanging out with a group of friends, sharing the same interests and experience. I try my best to replicate this in my streams, and ensure that I create an inclusive and welcoming atmosphere.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">I get a lot of viewers who ask a lot of similar questions about getting started in web development, and whilst this can throw some people off their stride whilst they&#x27;re trying to code, I make an effort to engage with every one of these viewers, as this kind of interaction is something I wish I&#x27;d had when I was starting out. And it&#x27;s these inquisitive viewers that I notice coming back again and again to be part of the evolving conversation.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">As your community grows, make sure you build up a core team of mods to support your whilst you&#x27;re streaming - they are invaluable to keeping your stream running smoothly.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Thank you to all my mods, <b class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK Typography_bodyCopy__bold__1jGZn">@Steffi128</b> and <b class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK Typography_bodyCopy__bold__1jGZn">@thatn00b__</b> in particular!</p><h2 class="Typography_heading__h2__3F_Oq">4. Let the look of your stream evolve organically</h2><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">When you&#x27;re first starting out, you can feel like your stream &#x27;doesn&#x27;t look good enough&#x27; compared to other channels.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">The options for the layout of your stream and the types of things you show on screen are pretty endless, and whilst there are a myriad tools out there to help you get set up relatively quickly, stream overlays and artwork can consume your time to the point where you feel like you don&#x27;t have any time to actually stream!</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">You don&#x27;t need to achieve &#x27;the perfect stream&#x27; look and feel before you press the go-live button. In fact, developing your stream overlays is perfect stream content - especially where programming is involved.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Let your stream look and feel evolve with your personality and content. Plus, it&#x27;s exciting for your viewers to return to your stream and find a new interactive feature they can play with rather than having it all laid out upfront!</p><h2 class="Typography_heading__h2__3F_Oq">5. Stream the content that motivates you</h2><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">We all get imposter syndrome, and to this day I still worry whether people will be interested in what I want to stream. But take it from me:</p><blockquote class="Typography_blockquote__12baU"><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">...if you try and stream content that doesn&#x27;t motivate you, or content that you&#x27;re not passionate about and invested in, you won&#x27;t enjoy it half as much.</p></blockquote><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">I usually stream content centred around front end development and the accessibilty and user experience considerations that come with it. When I first started out, I noticed that this kind of content was few and far between in the science and technology community on Twitch. And so it got me questioning.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK"><i>Did people really want to watch me make pretty, accessible websites? Or were they more interested in deep-diving into C#, Rust and Python?</i></p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">I experimented with streaming some very different content for a little while - and whilst it certainly brought some different viewers to my channel (and some have certainly stayed) - I didn&#x27;t feel as comfortable with this content as when I first started out.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK"><b class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK Typography_bodyCopy__bold__1jGZn">What&#x27;s more, if there&#x27;s a gap in the market for focussed front end content, then I have found my niche on Twitch!</b></p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">And this segues nicely to my final point:</p><h2 class="Typography_heading__h2__3F_Oq">6. The most valuable element to your stream is you</h2><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">The content you are streaming is only part of what you bring to the community. Viewers don&#x27;t necessarily return to your streams time and time again to learn about what you are coding - they come to hang out with you, chat with others, and to feel connected to a community.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">If you haven&#x27;t pressed the go-live button just yet, if you really want to get started on Twitch - and if you&#x27;re not feeling confident about your content - remember that the most valuable element to your stream is you - and there will be people out there who will certainly enjoy watching you, regardless of what you decide to do.</p><blockquote class="Typography_blockquote__12baU"><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">The more we can grow and engage with the science and technology community through streaming a variety of content, the more people we can empower through tech to grow their own futures in this ever-evolving world.</p></blockquote><h3 class="Typography_heading__h3__2AeD6"><a class="Typography_inlineLink__1AREs" href="https://github.com/whitep4nth3r/whitep4nth3r.codes/blob/main/content/6-things-I-learned-about-streaming-live-coding-in-my-first-6-weeks-on-Twitch.md#good-luck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>Good luck!</h3><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK"><i>Salma xxx</i></p>

    <p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK"><i>As my time as an engineering team lead comes to an end and I move into DevRel in 2021 - I wrote about how I prioritise empathy in tech teams over everything - something that will continue to stay with me firmly as my career continues to evolve.</i></p><hr class="RichTextPageContent_page__hr__1pze7"/><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">I’ve been working as a technical lead for almost six years. During this time I’ve had the opportunity to work with diverse groups of people to build a variety of different products including e-commerce platforms, energy switching services, brochure websites and personal gifting experiences to name but a few.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Regardless of the product, in-house company or client, external factors or urgency of deadlines – these very different experiences have one thing in common: every single team has been an incredibly high-performing and collaborative group of people.</p><h2 class="Typography_heading__h2__3F_Oq">What’s my secret?</h2><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">For those that have worked with me, you might attribute this to the rigorous weekly processes that I support the team to put in place: prioritisation sessions, team retrospectives, Wednesday planning sessions (the day here is very important!), morning stand-ups and afternoon catch-ups.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">You might also credit success to the unrelenting autonomy that I encourage within teams, ensuring that people are given the freedom to be creative, experiment, and own the way that products are built and delivered.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">But these are all just ways of working. And what I want to talk about today is a way of <i>being</i>.</p><h2 class="Typography_heading__h2__3F_Oq">Being human beings</h2><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Human beings are complicated. We are a bag of experiences, emotions, fears, hopes, dreams, preferences and choices. Some of us have big families, some of us live alone, some of us care for others. Some of us are extroverted, introverted, somewhere in between. We learn in different ways, we respond intuitively to music, language, colours, weather, seasons, other people.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">We’re all so incredibly different, yet all so incredibly interlinked by our human need to be <i>heard and understood.</i></p><h2 class="Typography_heading__h2__3F_Oq">Good leaders make you feel safe</h2><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Empathy is defined as the ability to <i>understand and share the feelings of another</i>. It sounds incredibly easy to be empathetic in theory, but whilst the stresses of the 2020 global pandemic and beyond keeps us firmly in survival mode, it’s increasingly tricky, but also increasingly important to practise empathy with our colleagues.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">As human beings, we need psychological safety now more than ever. Now is the time to come together to lift each other up and out of survival mode, so we are free to explore, create and experiment, in order to reach our full potential at work.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Here are my top five guiding principles that help me prioritise leading teams through an empathy-first approach.</p><h2 class="Typography_heading__h2__3F_Oq">1. I am not a manager</h2><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">The most prevalent way to develop an empathetic relationship with your team is to be part of the team. Notice that I never refer to team leads as ‘managers’. Your role as a team lead is to provide direction, support and protection – not to ‘manage’ or ‘take charge of’ in the traditional sense.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">If you, as a team lead are integrated with your team, are involved in (but not necessarily leading) team ceremonies, pair-programming with developers, and architecting roadmaps with product owners – you are much more likely to <i>understand and share their feelings</i> as a result of being in the same shared situations.</p><h2 class="Typography_heading__h2__3F_Oq">2. You are not a resource</h2><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">This is a tricky subject when working at a product studio that adopts an agency model, where clients are often billed by the hour for people’s time. The most impactful thing you can do is humanise your team and refer to people as people – not resources.</p><h2 class="Typography_heading__h2__3F_Oq">3. You can only go as fast as you can go</h2><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK"><i>We have to go faster! We must increase velocity! We should deliver at pace! Do this ASAP!</i></p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">I think Basecamp (<a class="Typography_inlineLink__1AREs" href="https://basecamp.com/guides/how-we-communicate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guide to Internal Communication, the Basecamp Way</a>) said it best: “Urgency is overrated, ASAP is poison.”</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Until every part of a developer’s job is automated (I give it until the year 2100), human beings can only go as fast as human beings can go. We can only define requirements for a product so quickly, only prioritise the roadmap so efficiently, only type on our keyboards so fast, and release changes when they’re fully tested and ready.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Without delving into a completely different topic on the toxicity of arbitrary deadlines – you, the team and its individuals can only go as fast as you can go. Ensure that as a team lead you are offering your team this level of protection from external pressures. Allow your team the space to be creative, grow, explore, and factor this into estimates, roadmaps and time planning.</p><h2 class="Typography_heading__h2__3F_Oq">4. You are never ‘too’ emotional</h2><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Your team members are not machines. They are human beings with complex emotions and hormones and chemicals and feelings and thoughts and a life to live outside of work. Sometimes days are more challenging than others – and that’s okay. Encourage your team members to take care of themselves and to take time and space away from their computer screens.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Lend your team members a compassionate ear when they need it. Encourage them to explore their challenges and successes with you and get to know them as people. In doing this you’ll be able to build up a clear picture of how your team will respond to certain situations, so you’ll be able to proactively prepare to protect them if the need should arise.</p><h2 class="Typography_heading__h2__3F_Oq">5. This is just a job</h2><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">The most important lesson I’ve learned from Steve Parker, Product Owner and one of my most valued colleagues at Code – is despite how passionate you are about your craft, don’t put too much pressure on yourself at work.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">After all, it’s just a job. (I can hear this in his voice, now). There are more important things to be worrying about.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">No one’s going to die (at least at Code).</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK"><i></i></p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[ 
    <p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">After navigating a varied career path — including teaching music and performing musical comedy — Salma, or @whitep4nth3r as she has come to be known across the vast interwebs, joined our DevRel team at Contentful in January 2021. 🎉 We managed to catch Salma amidst her busy onboarding schedule to learn about what led her to developer relations and how she accidentally increased engagement in the<a class="Typography_inlineLink__1AREs" href="https://www.contentful.com/slack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Contentful Community Slack</a> by 200% on her first day at Contentful.</p><h2 class="Typography_heading__h2__3F_Oq">Hello, Salma! We’re thrilled to have you on the team! How did you get into tech?</h2><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">There are four chapters to my journey in tech. </p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">I’ll start with the story of my earliest memory in front of a computer. There was an old Commodore 64 machine kicking around my house in the 1980s — you know, the type of thing where you loaded a cassette tape into a strange contraption hooked up to a chunky computer keyboard. After pressing play on the cassette player, you had to literally go outside and play because it would take about an hour before the game was actually playable.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">I remember there was a four-inch thick programming manual that came with this C64, and during my early days of learning to read, I decided to explore it.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">I was around six years old at the time, and to cut an increasingly (an unnecessarily) long story short, I remember sitting in front of that machine for hours at a time, meticulously copying symbols from the manual (only recently did I learn I was writing BASIC), character by character, into a fascinating blue terminal screen. </p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">And MAGIC happened! I made a ball bounce across the screen! I printed patterns! I made coloured stripes! I could do ANYTHING! I was hooked.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">But this was 1991, and the internet wasn’t a thing for most people yet. I didn’t even know how to articulate that I really, really, <i>really</i> wanted to explore this. I probably didn’t even have the word “programming” in my vocabulary yet; and, I had no idea what I was doing. But I did know that I was incredibly entranced by the whole experience.</p><h2 class="Typography_heading__h2__3F_Oq">What happened after you mastered programming in BASIC at the age of six?</h2><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">At this point in my life I had already gotten heavily into learning music, so this took over.  I don’t think it’s a coincidence that my degree is in music composition. There are so many similarities between the way I write music and code. Both are motif based. Short, reusable snippets of code are like short, reusable musical motifs. </p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">The second chapter of my journey into tech happened in 1998 at the dawn of the dial-up home internet connection. The internet was just as fascinating to me as writing BASIC on a C64. Information was everywhere, communication with friends was no longer confined to a landline telephone conversation and I discovered the joy of building websites with the now-defunct GeoCities.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">My first website had all the bells and whistles of a website built in the 90s: a visitor counter, a guest book, terribly inaccessible animations, an abundance of #0000FF (also known as “internet blue”) and lots of personality. In fact, I am so fond of the nostalgia of the internet in the 90s that I recently completed a frontend challenge where <a class="Typography_inlineLink__1AREs" href="https://stylestage.dev/styles/geocities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>I recreated the look and feel of a GeoCities website entirely in CSS</u></a>. The good thing about this version is that it’s responsive and accessible! </p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">With limited resources to really come to grips with programming at the time, I continued to pursue music, and went to study music composition at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester. </p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">But my tech pursuits didn’t stop there. As I got more and more into music technology and production, I moved away from Windows and embraced Macs. And, back then, iMacs came bundled with another deprecated piece of software: iWeb. </p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">At this point, I started experimenting with iWeb to build websites. iWeb was a drag-and-drop website builder. If you used images for most of the elements on the page, and iframes that sourced text files for dynamic content, you could end up with a pretty snazzy looking result! (If you ignored the fact that the page wasn’t accessible or responsive.) This is also how I gained some skills in graphic design.</p><h2 class="Typography_heading__h2__3F_Oq">What happened after you graduated?</h2><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Being a recent music graduate, paid work was few and far between. So I made a little bit of a living designing album artwork and complementary websites (using iWeb) for my musician friends, which were hosted in strange places and edited by uploading file changes via an FTP file server — all while I recorded and released an album on Spotify with my folk band. </p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">You would never believe that, at the time of this interview, <a class="Typography_inlineLink__1AREs" href="http://www.thesterlingtrio.com/thesterlingtrio.com/Home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>this website I built using iWeb</u></a> is still live on the internet. </p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">I haven’t inspected the code to see how it compares to modern web standards. I’m too afraid.Tell us about your first job in development</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">I’ll skip over the few years that involved becoming a qualified music teacher, teaching kids how to play in rock bands and gigging as a musical comedian, to when I abruptly decided to quit teaching altogether and found myself working in a call center. </p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Through a series of serendipitous events, my graphic design experience led me to what became my first development role for a small magazine website, which operated above a furniture shop in a tiny northern UK village.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">The three previous chapters in tech had given me some limited experience, but I managed to convince the one “IT guy” there (he was responsible for the infrastructure, backend, frontend and CMS) to take me under his wing. I was really fortunate to be able to learn on the job.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">It’s so important to have a mentor. Whether you’re learning on the job or learning on your own, having someone to talk with about programming problems is absolutely invaluable. After all, programming isn’t necessarily about writing code. It’s about solving problems and building things for real people to use. </p><h2 class="Typography_heading__h2__3F_Oq">How did your career in tech evolve from there?</h2><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">I’ve worked on a variety of different software products, including global ecommerce platforms, SaaS startups, mobile apps and, most recently, at a product agency in Manchester, UK. </p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">I think the experience I had in graphic design greatly influenced my choice to specialize in frontend technologies. Due to my teaching and leadership experience before my final journey chapter, I moved on to working as a tech lead quite early on in my tech career. I’ve been involved in a lot of backend technologies and architecture for some time, too.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">2020 was a strange year for everyone. And in that strange year, I discovered that I quite enjoyed <a class="Typography_inlineLink__1AREs" href="https://twitch.tv/whitep4nth3r" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>streaming live coding on Twitch</u></a>. Through building a community around my Twitch channel, I was fortunate to be introduced to the world of DevRel. I didn’t even know it existed until a few months ago. </p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">I feel very lucky to have found my first DevRel role at such a welcoming company that builds a product that makes frontend applications so easy to build — something I have always advocated for.</p><h2 class="Typography_heading__h2__3F_Oq">Finally — how did you increase engagement in the Contentful Community Slack by 200% on your first day?</h2><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">I’m a growth hacker! An innovator! </p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">… I pressed the wrong button and accidentally enabled two-factor authentication for all c. 5,000 members of the Contentful Community Slack. And now I am fondly known as the team security champion. 🚨</p><h2 class="Typography_heading__h2__3F_Oq">Great work! Any final words?</h2><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Build stuff, learn things, love what you do.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">If you’d like to stay up to date with what’s happening in Salma’s world, find her on <a class="Typography_inlineLink__1AREs" href="https://twitch.tv/whitep4nther" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Twitch</u></a> and in the rainy suburbs of Manchester, UK. Or join the <a class="Typography_inlineLink__1AREs" href="https://www.contentful.com/slack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Contentful Community</u></a><a class="Typography_inlineLink__1AREs" href="https://www.contentful.com/slack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> Slack</u></a> —  just make sure you’re on top of your security. 😉</p>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[ 
    <p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">I’m a big believer in the KISS principle in web development. KISS is an acronym for the phrase “keep it simple, stupid” — and while I don’t advocate for calling anyone “stupid” 🙈 — I definitely advocate for keeping things very simple when learning to work with new technology.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Before joining Contentful as a developer evangelist in January 2021, I purposefully avoided using Contentful in my front-end projects so that I could come to it with fresh eyes and explore it with purpose and meaning.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">So, with this being my first-ever app built using Contentful (🎉), I wanted to make sure I focused my efforts on learning this single technology, rather than getting bogged down with other front-end frameworks and technologies such as Angular, React, Vue or Svelte (which are all great, by the way!).</p><h2 class="Typography_heading__h2__3F_Oq">What do you mean, no front-end frameworks?</h2><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK"><i>thingoftheday</i> is a simple static site built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript; there are no packages to install, no build commands to run, and no framework patterns to follow.  </p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Sidenote: It was really fun to get back to basics using native JavaScript functionality such as <code class="Typography_inlineCode__1NvTR">document.querySelector </code>and <code class="Typography_inlineCode__1NvTR">document.createElement</code> in this app. As an added bonus, the single-page application is super fast and is deployed instantly (to Netlify) whenever the repository receives new changes.</p><h3 class="Typography_heading__h3__2AeD6">Sounds great! How do I get started?</h3><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">If you’re the type who likes to fork a repository and get stuck into the code straight away (I know I am!), I’ve included a <a class="Typography_inlineLink__1AREs" href="https://github.com/whitep4nth3r/thingoftheday#thingoftheday" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>quick-start guide on GitHub here </u></a>where you can import the content type and example content defined in this tutorial using the Contentful CLI in a matter of minutes. You can also get started by watching this quick tutorial video.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Have fun!</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Here’s what you’ll need to be able to build a lightweight microblogging site the old-school way with Contentful.</p><h3 class="Typography_heading__h3__2AeD6">A Contentful account</h3><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">You can <a class="Typography_inlineLink__1AREs" href="https://www.contentful.com/sign-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>sign up for a free Contentful account</u></a> here.</p><h3 class="Typography_heading__h3__2AeD6">Optional: Prepare your development environment</h3><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">If you want to use es6 syntax in your vanilla JavaScript file, you’ll need to serve your module file to the browser over an http-server in your local development environment. You can do this with <a class="Typography_inlineLink__1AREs" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>this nifty npm package</u></a>, aptly titled “http-server.”</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">That’s everything you need!</p><h2 class="Typography_heading__h2__3F_Oq">Let’s get building!</h2><h3 class="Typography_heading__h3__2AeD6">Create your space in Contentful</h3><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Call it whatever you like. We’ll go with <i>thingoftheday.</i></p><div class="RichTextPageContent_page__imgContainer__3my1e"><div style="display:block;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="display:block;box-sizing:border-box;padding-top:59.06249999999999%"></div><img alt="An animated GIF showing how to create a Contentful space" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" style="visibility:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/></div></div><h3 class="Typography_heading__h3__2AeD6">Create and define your content type</h3><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Before we write any code, we’re going to create our content type<i> </i>inside our space<i>. </i></p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">What’s great about Contentful is that it encourages you to approach your applications with a data-first mindset. I have always advocated for building applications from the “middle out,”  which means defining your data structures and how they might be extended before beginning any development on a project. With this method, both backend and front-end development teams can get to work simultaneously. This is how agile teams work effectively, especially in large organizations. </p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Your content is the most important building block of your applications. Without its data, your application doesn’t have a voice.</p><h3 class="Typography_heading__h3__2AeD6">Wait, what’s a content type?</h3><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">A content type is a collection of bits of data you’d like to group together. Think of it like an object in JavaScript. </p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">For example, you might have a <a class="Typography_inlineLink__1AREs" href="https://www.contentful.com/help/contentful-glossary/#content-type" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">content type</a> of a <code class="Typography_inlineCode__1NvTR">cat</code>. Your <code class="Typography_inlineCode__1NvTR">cat</code> will have different fields that are used to describe it (or properties in JavaScript object land), which might be <code class="Typography_inlineCode__1NvTR">breed</code>, <code class="Typography_inlineCode__1NvTR">numberOfLegs</code> or <code class="Typography_inlineCode__1NvTR">favoriteBrandOfCatFood</code>. These fields will be of certain types (think text, date, media). If you’re familiar with strongly typed programming languages such as TypeScript, this might feel nice and familiar.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">The purpose of <i>thingoftheday</i> is to capture a small image/snippet/tweet/link/thing each day that I’ve learned, or to record proud achievements that I wanted to remember forever that won’t get lost in a Twitter timeline.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">The basic requirements for the microblog are to display the following per post:</p><ul class="RichTextPageContent_page__ul__1STgU"><li class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK RichTextPageContent_page__li__Flxfd"><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Some text </p></li><li class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK RichTextPageContent_page__li__Flxfd"><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">An image</p></li><li class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK RichTextPageContent_page__li__Flxfd"><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">An external link</p></li><li class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK RichTextPageContent_page__li__Flxfd"><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Some text for the link </p></li><li class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK RichTextPageContent_page__li__Flxfd"><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">A panther emote that represented my mood on the day</p></li></ul><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">And this is what we’ll use to build our content type!</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">In case you’re wondering about the panther emote — or any of the panthers that you’ll see if you follow me online — let me explain. It started off as a bit of a tongue-in-cheek thing. My handle, @whitep4nth3r, is what I would call myself if I were a member of FSociety. (If you haven’t watched Mr. Robot, you need to.) The panthers just expanded from there. For example, if you watch <a class="Typography_inlineLink__1AREs" href="https://www.twitch.tv/whitep4nth3r" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>my Twitch stream</u></a>, you can express yourself with a plethora of panther emotes and drop different flavors of panther rain on me. I use these panthers to express my current mood at the time on my <a class="Typography_inlineLink__1AREs" href="https://twitch.tv/whitep4nth3r" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Twitch stream</u></a>. The panthers have just become a “thing” — so they will be a “thing” for <i>thingoftheday</i>!</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Here’s a quick video tutorial on how to set up the content type for our microblog.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">We’ve now created our content type for our blog posts. 🎉</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Here’s what the UI should contain when you click on the content model navigation tab.</p><div class="RichTextPageContent_page__imgContainer__3my1e"><div style="display:block;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="display:block;box-sizing:border-box;padding-top:49.81949458483754%"></div><img alt="A screenshot of a finished content model for thingoftheday" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" style="visibility:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/></div></div><h3 class="Typography_heading__h3__2AeD6">Now, for the content!</h3><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Let’s add our first microblog post!</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Navigate to the content tab and click on add microblog.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Add some fun stuff, then click the big green publish button. </p><div class="RichTextPageContent_page__imgContainer__3my1e"><div style="display:block;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="display:block;box-sizing:border-box;padding-top:65.9375%"></div><img alt="An animated GIF showing the creation of a blog post" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" style="visibility:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/></div></div><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Navigate back to the content tab, and you’ll find your shiny new microblog post in the list. ✨</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">The text field has been used for the entry title in the name column as we specified earlier.</p><div class="RichTextPageContent_page__imgContainer__3my1e"><div style="display:block;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="display:block;box-sizing:border-box;padding-top:23.623853211009173%"></div><img alt="Image showing the published piece of content" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" style="visibility:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/></div></div><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Congrats! You’ve created your first post with your very own content type in Contentful. 😎</p><h3 class="Typography_heading__h3__2AeD6">Next up, fetch your content</h3><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">In order to fetch your content, you’ll need two pieces of data. Your space ID and an access token. <a class="Typography_inlineLink__1AREs" href="https://www.contentful.com/help/personal-access-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>You can read more about personal access tokens here.</u></a></p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Head on over to the settings tab, click general settings, and find your space ID at the top of the page.</p><div class="RichTextPageContent_page__imgContainer__3my1e"><div style="display:block;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="display:block;box-sizing:border-box;padding-top:35.67567567567568%"></div><img alt="Screenshot showing where to find the Contentful space ID" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" style="visibility:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/></div></div><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Click on the settings tab again, and click on API keys.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Click on the big blue add API key button, configure what you need and copy the content delivery API - access token.</p><div class="RichTextPageContent_page__imgContainer__3my1e"><div style="display:block;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="display:block;box-sizing:border-box;padding-top:12.015018773466833%"></div><img alt="A screenshot showing where to find the Contentful Delivery API access token" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" style="visibility:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/></div></div><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Click save. Now we’re ready to rock and roll!</p><h3 class="Typography_heading__h3__2AeD6">The Content Delivery API</h3><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Contentful offers a few ways to fetch content, including <a class="Typography_inlineLink__1AREs" href="https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the REST API</u></a> and the <a class="Typography_inlineLink__1AREs" href="https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/graphql/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GraphQL API</u></a>. We’re going to use the GraphQL API for this application, because there’s no need to download any packages or SDKs, and, most importantly, it’s a fantastic way to request only the data you need for the front end. No need to deal with huge complex payloads with lots of irrelevant system information!</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Remember — keep it simple, stupid! 🙈</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Sidenote: If JavaScript isn’t your thing, <a class="Typography_inlineLink__1AREs" href="https://www.contentful.com/blog/2021/01/14/GraphQL-via-HTTP-in-five-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>check out how you can also use the GraphQL API with cURL, Python, Ruby and PHP here</u></a>. Thanks Shy!</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Let’s head over to Contentful’s GraphiQL interface using the following URL configured with your space ID and access token:</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Here’s where we’ll construct our GraphQL query to use in our application code.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">You might need to play around a bit with the format of your query depending on your content type fields (and whether or not you chose to include panthers!), but here’s some example code to get you started.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">A key thing to note is that the name of your content type (i.e. microblog) will need to be queried as a collection, e.g. microblogCollection, with a property of items.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Notice that the query is constructed from the automatically generated field names we defined when we set up our content type. Give it a go!</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">You’ll also notice that I’m requesting some system information in this query (sys.firstPublishedAt). You’re free to add a separate date field to your microblog content type if you wish, instead of using the system information. Moreover, if you’re using the Contentful REST API, sys.created and sys.updated will be available for you to consume.</p><h3 class="Typography_heading__h3__2AeD6">Finally, let’s write some vanilla front-end code!</h3><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Let’s set up a basic HTML boilerplate file and add links to our CSS file and JS file.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Since we’re using vanilla JavaScript, we’re going to use the native fetch<i> </i>api in our code.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">The aim of this next part is to fetch our content from Contentful in our app.js file, and log it to the browser console.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Use the query you constructed in the GraphiQL interface, construct your fetch options and fetch that data!</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">You might be worried that you’re using sensitive data (space ID and access token) in your code directly rather than using environment variables (as you would usually do in a framework like React), but don’t fret!</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Contentful’s Content Delivery API (or CDA) is a read-only API. If you’re using Contentful to fetch public data, there’s nothing to worry about. If you would prefer to keep your Contentful credentials private, I would recommend proxying the data fetched from Contentful to your client via your own API server application.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Start your http-server and check out the console in your browser. </p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">We have content! 🎉</p><div class="RichTextPageContent_page__imgContainer__3my1e"><div style="display:block;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="display:block;box-sizing:border-box;padding-top:59.432799013563496%"></div><img alt="Checking the console in the browser for the fetched content" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" style="visibility:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/></div></div><h3 class="Typography_heading__h3__2AeD6">Let’s add our content to the DOM!</h3><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">For each bit of data of each item in the returned array, we’ll want to create an HTML element and append it to the DOM.</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">Here’s a example function to get you started:</p><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK"> You’ll now find your posts as unstyled HTML in the browser!</p><div class="RichTextPageContent_page__imgContainer__3my1e"><div style="display:block;overflow:hidden;position:relative;box-sizing:border-box;margin:0"><div style="display:block;box-sizing:border-box;padding-top:40.856031128404666%"></div><img alt="A screenshot of the HTML written to the DOM in the browser source code" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" style="visibility:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/></div></div><p class="Typography_bodyCopy__1n-AK">With a little bit of date formatting, adding some classes to the HTML and some vanilla CSS magic, you’ll end up with something like this in no time.
